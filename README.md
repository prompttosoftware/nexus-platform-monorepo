## 1. About Nexus

The Nexus platform is a comprehensive Supply Chain Management (SCM) solution designed to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve visibility across the entire supply chain for businesses. It provides robust tools for managing inventory, logistics, and shipping activities in real-time.

## 2. Key Features

*   **Inventory Management:** Real-time stock levels, warehouse locations, and inventory movements.
*   **Logistics Management:** Optimization of transportation routes, fleet management, and carrier integration.
*   **Shipping Management:** Streamlined order fulfillment, packing, label generation, and dispatch processes.
*   **Real-time Tracking:** End-to-end tracking of goods in transit and warehouse inventory.
*   **Automated Workflows:** Automation of key supply chain processes (e.g., order processing, replenishment).
*   **ERP System Integration:** Seamless data exchange with popular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.

## 3. System Architecture

Nexus is built on a **microservices architecture** to ensure scalability, resilience, independent deployability, and maintainability. Services communicate primarily via RESTful APIs for synchronous requests and Apache Kafka for asynchronous, event-driven communication.

### Core Principles

*   **Loose Coupling:** Services operate independently with minimal dependencies.
*   **High Cohesion:** Each service focuses on a specific business capability.
*   **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
*   **Resilience:** Failure in one service does not propagate and bring down the entire system.

### Technology Stack

*   **Backend Services:** Go (Golang)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (for relational data), Redis (for caching & real-time data)
*   **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka
*   **Frontend (Web):** React with TypeScript
*   **API Gateway:** Nginx / Kong
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s)
*   **Cloud Platform:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## 4. Core Components (Microservices)

This monorepo contains the following microservices, each responsible for a distinct domain:

### User and Identity Service

Manages user authentication (login, registration), authorization (roles, permissions), and user profiles. Uses PostgreSQL for data storage and implements OAuth2/OpenID Connect (JWTs).

### Inventory Service

Manages product catalog, stock levels, warehouse locations, inventory adjustments, and movements. Publishes `InventoryUpdated` events to Kafka and consumes `OrderCreated` for stock reservation.

### Order Service

Manages the lifecycle of customer orders. Publishes `OrderCreated`, `OrderUpdated`, `OrderCancelled` events to Kafka and consumes `InventoryReserved` events.

### Shipment Service

Handles individual shipments, tracking numbers, carrier integrations, and label generation. Publishes `ShipmentCreated`, `ShipmentStatusUpdated`, `TrackingUpdate` events to Kafka and consumes `OrderFulfilled` events.

### Logistics Service

Manages transportation routes, vehicle fleet, driver assignments, and delivery schedules. Consumes `ShipmentCreated` events and publishes `RouteOptimized` events.

### Workflow Automation Service

Orchestrates multi-step business processes based on events consumed from Kafka. Examples include order fulfillment flows, low stock alerts, and re-order triggers.

### ERP Integration Service

Facilitates data synchronization and communication between Nexus and external ERP systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle). Handles data mapping, transformation, and API/file exchanges. Consumes relevant Kafka events and publishes updates from ERPs.

### Real-time Tracking Service (Backend for UI)

Ingests high-volume tracking data (e.g., from GPS devices, carrier updates) via Kafka (`TrackingUpdate` events). Processes and serves real-time location updates to the frontend via WebSockets, utilizing Redis for current location snapshots.

### Frontend Web Application

A user-friendly single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. It communicates with backend services via the API Gateway (REST) and Real-time Tracking Service (WebSockets), providing intuitive interfaces for all Nexus functionalities.

## 5. Infrastructure and Deployment

*   **Cloud Provider:** AWS
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
*   **Database:** AWS RDS for PostgreSQL, AWS ElastiCache for Redis
*   **Message Broker:** AWS MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka)
*   **Storage:** Amazon S3 (for static assets, labels, reports)
*   **Networking:** AWS VPC, ALB, Route 53
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD (Build, Test, Scan, Deploy)
*   **Deployment Strategy:** Rolling updates via Kubernetes, GitOps with Argo CD
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

A comprehensive testing strategy is employed across the platform:

*   **Unit Tests:** For individual functions/components (Go: `go test`, React: Jest/React Testing Library).
*   **Integration Tests:** For interactions between services and their direct dependencies (Go: `Testcontainers-go` for databases/Kafka, React: React Testing Library with MSW).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Simulate critical user journeys across the full system (Cypress for frontend, Newman/Postman for API flows).
*   **Mocking Strategy:** Prioritizes dependency injection, simple stubs, and mocking at system boundaries.
*   **Test Data Management:** Clean, predictable datasets with factories for generation and proper cleanup.

## 7. Monitoring & Logging

*   **Metrics:** Prometheus for collection, Grafana for visualization.
*   **Logging:** Centralized structured JSON logging via ELK Stack or AWS CloudWatch Logs.
*   **Tracing:** Distributed tracing with Jaeger or AWS X-Ray.
*   **Alerting:** Prometheus Alertmanager integrated with PagerDuty/Slack.
*   **Health Checks:** Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.

## 8. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth2/OpenID Connect (JWTs), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
*   **Data Encryption:** TLS/SSL for in-transit, AWS KMS for data at rest.
*   **Input Validation:** Strict server-side validation.
*   **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager or Kubernetes Secrets.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning in CI/CD.
*   **Network Security:** VPCs, Security Groups, Network ACLs.
*   **Least Privilege:** IAM roles with minimal permissions.
*   **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive audit trails.

## 9. Performance & Scalability

*   **Microservices:** Enables independent scaling.
*   **Go Lang:** High performance and concurrency.
*   **Kafka & Redis:** High-throughput components.
*   **Kubernetes Autoscaling:** HPA/Cluster Autoscaler.
*   **Database Scaling:** AWS RDS read replicas, connection pooling.
*   **Caching:** Strategic use of Redis.
*   **Load Testing:** Regular load and stress testing using JMeter or k6.

## 10. Dependencies

*   **Internal Microservices:** All microservices interact via REST APIs and Kafka events.
*   **External ERP Systems:** (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics)
*   **Shipping Carriers:** (e.g., FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS)
*   **Mapping Services:** (e.g., Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap)
