# Nexus Supply Chain Management Platform - Project Plan

## 1. Introduction and Overview

The Nexus platform is designed to revolutionize supply chain management by providing businesses with a comprehensive solution for inventory, logistics, and shipping activities. It aims to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve visibility across the entire supply chain.

**Key Features:**
*   **Inventory Management:** Real-time visibility of stock levels, warehouse locations, and inventory movements.
*   **Logistics Management:** Optimization of transportation routes, fleet management, and carrier integration.
*   **Shipping Management:** Streamlined order fulfillment, packing, label generation, and dispatch processes.
*   **Real-time Tracking:** End-to-end tracking of goods in transit and warehouse inventory.
*   **Automated Workflows:** Automation of key supply chain processes like order processing, replenishment, and shipping notifications.
*   **ERP System Integration:** Seamless data exchange with popular Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.

## 2. System Architecture

Nexus will be built using a **microservices architecture** to ensure scalability, resilience, independent deployability, and maintainability. Services will communicate primarily via RESTful APIs for synchronous requests and Kafka for asynchronous event-driven communication.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Loose Coupling:** Services operate independently.
*   **High Cohesion:** Each service focuses on a specific business capability.
*   **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
*   **Resilience:** Failure in one service does not bring down the entire system.

**Technology Stack (Proposed):**
*   **Backend Services:** Go (Golang) for high performance, concurrency, and efficiency.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data persistence (transactional data). Redis for caching and real-time data manipulation (e.g., session management, short-lived tracking data).
*   **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka for high-throughput, low-latency asynchronous communication, event streaming, and real-time data ingestion (e.g., tracking updates).
*   **Frontend (Web Application):** React with TypeScript for a robust, interactive, and modern user interface.
*   **API Gateway:** Nginx or Kong to manage external API traffic, provide routing, load balancing, and security.
*   **Containerization:** Docker for packaging services.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K8s) for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.
*   **Cloud Platform:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) for infrastructure, managed services (e.g., RDS, MSK, EKS).

## 3. Core Components (Microservices)

Each core component will be a standalone microservice responsible for a specific domain.

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

This section reiterates and expands on the TDD verification principles mentioned for each service.

### 5.1. Testing Hierarchy

1.  **Unit Tests (Go: `go test`, React: Jest/React Testing Library):**
    *   **Focus:** Individual functions, methods, or components in isolation.
    *   **Execution:** Fast, run frequently by developers.
    *   **Coverage:** Aim for high coverage on core business logic.
    *   **Mocking:** Minimal. Use `testify/mock` for interface mocking in Go services, Jest mocks for React components. Prefer real objects via dependency injection where applicable. Start with pure functions and simple logic. Test happy paths before edge cases.
2.  **Integration Tests (Go: Testcontainers-go, React: React Testing Library with mocked APIs):**
    *   **Focus:** Interactions between components within a service, or interactions between a service and its direct dependencies (database, message queue).
    *   **Execution:** Slower than unit tests, run in CI/CD.
    *   **Mocking:** Use lightweight test doubles for external services (e.g., `httptest` for HTTP clients). Use Testcontainers for real databases (PostgreSQL), Redis, and Kafka in ephemeral containers. Prefer real implementations (e.g., embedded databases) over complex mocks.
3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Cypress for Frontend, Newman/Postman for API flows):**
    *   **Focus:** Simulate critical user journeys across the entire system, including frontend, backend, and external integrations (mocked).
    *   **Execution:** Slowest, run less frequently (e.g., nightly, before major deployments).
    *   **Coverage:** Focus on critical paths, not every nuance.
    *   **Strategy:** Automated browser tests (Cypress) for UI flows. API collection runners (Newman) for backend API flows. Mock external ERPs/Carriers for E2E scenarios.

### 5.2. Mocking Strategy

*   **Prefer Dependency Injection:** Design services with interfaces for external dependencies (database, Kafka client, HTTP clients). This allows for easy injection of test doubles.
*   **Simple Stubs:** When external calls are unavoidable in unit tests, provide simple stub implementations that return predictable data.
*   **Mock at System Boundaries:** Only mock external dependencies (e.g., database, Kafka, other microservices, third-party APIs) when testing a component. Avoid over-mocking internal logic.
*   **Test Doubles Hierarchy:**
    1.  **Real Implementations:** Use whenever possible (e.g., actual Go structs, React components).
    2.  **Fake Implementations:** Lightweight, in-memory implementations of interfaces (e.g., an in-memory `UserRepository` for a `UserRepository` interface).
    3.  **Stubs:** Objects that provide canned answers to calls (e.g., a function that always returns a specific product).
    4.  **Mocks:** Objects that record calls and verify behavior. Use sparingly, primarily for verifying interactions with external systems or complex collaborators.

### 5.3. Testing Tools & Frameworks

*   **Go:** `testing` package (built-in), `testify/assert` (assertions), `testify/mock` (mocking), `dockertest` or `Testcontainers-go` (integration tests with real dependencies), `go-kafka` testing tools.
*   **React:** Jest (test runner), React Testing Library (component testing), MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking in development/testing.
*   **E2E:** Cypress (frontend), Postman/Newman (API).

### 5.4. Test Data Management

*   **Seeding:** Use clean, predictable datasets for integration and E2E tests. Database migration tools (e.g., `goose`, `migrate`) can include test data seeding scripts.
*   **Factories:** Develop data factories (e.g., using `gofakeit` in Go, or `faker.js` in JS) to generate realistic but predictable test data on the fly.
*   **Cleanup:** Ensure test environments are torn down and data is purged after tests, especially for integration tests using ephemeral containers.

## 6. Monitoring & Logging

*   **Metrics:** Prometheus for collecting metrics (request rates, error rates, latency, resource utilization – CPU, memory). Grafana for dashboards and visualization.
*   **Logging:** Centralized logging with the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or AWS CloudWatch Logs. Each service will log structured JSON data.
*   **Tracing:** Distributed tracing with Jaeger or AWS X-Ray to track requests across microservices.
*   **Alerting:** Prometheus Alertmanager integrated with PagerDuty or Slack for critical alerts. CloudWatch Alarms for infrastructure.
*   **Health Checks:** Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes for service health.

## 7. Security Considerations

*   **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth2/OpenID Connect (JWTs) for API authentication. RBAC for fine-grained authorization.
*   **Data Encryption:** TLS/SSL for all in-transit data (internal and external APIs). Data at rest encryption for databases and storage (AWS KMS).
*   **Input Validation:** Strict server-side validation for all inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.).
*   **Secrets Management:** AWS Secrets Manager or Kubernetes Secrets for credentials, API keys.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** SAST (Static Application Security Testing) in CI/CD. Regular DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) on deployed applications. Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Security:** VPCs, Security Groups, Network ACLs to restrict service-to-service communication and external access.
*   **Least Privilege:** Configure IAM roles with minimal necessary permissions for services and deployments.
*   **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive audit trails for sensitive actions.

## 8. Performance & Scalability

*   **Microservices:** Enables independent scaling of services based on demand.
*   **Go Lang:** High performance and concurrency characteristics.
*   **Kafka:** High-throughput, distributed message broker for async tasks and event streaming.
*   **Redis:** In-memory data store for caching and fast real-time data access.
*   **Kubernetes Autoscaling:** Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory utilization or custom metrics. Cluster Autoscaler for underlying nodes.
*   **Database Scaling:** AWS RDS read replicas for read-heavy services, connection pooling.
*   **Caching:** Strategic use of Redis for frequently accessed static or slowly changing data.
*   **Load Testing:** Conduct regular load and stress testing using tools like JMeter or k6.

## 9. Dependencies

*   **Internal Microservices:** All microservices are interdependent via API calls and Kafka events.
*   **External ERP Systems:** SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics (specific versions to be confirmed).
*   **Shipping Carriers:** FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS (specific APIs and versions to be confirmed).
*   **Mapping Services:** Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap (for route optimization/tracking visualization).
*   **Payment Gateway:** (Future consideration, not in MVP) Stripe, PayPal.
*   **Email/SMS Gateway:** AWS SES/SNS or SendGrid/Twilio.

## 10. Potential Risks & Mitigations

*   **Risk: Complexity of Distributed Systems (Microservices Overhead)**
    *   **Mitigation:** Adopt strong DevOps practices, comprehensive monitoring, centralized logging, and automated CI/CD. Start with a simpler architectural pattern and evolve.
*   **Risk: Data Consistency Across Services**
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement eventual consistency patterns (Sagas with Kafka), idempotent consumers, and robust error handling with dead-letter queues. Monitoring metrics for data discrepancies.
*   **Risk: Integration Challenges with Diverse ERPs/Carriers**
    *   **Mitigation:** Start with a few popular integrations. Develop robust, configurable integration service with strong error handling and retry mechanisms. Utilize partner APIs/SDKs when available. Thorough documentation and testing.
*   **Risk: Performance Bottlenecks with Real-time Tracking**
    *   **Mitigation:** Leverage highly optimized technologies (Go, Kafka, Redis). Implement aggressive caching strategies. Horizontal scaling of tracking service. Conduct detailed load testing early.
*   **Risk: Security Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Mitigation:** Integrate security best practices throughout the SDLC (DevSecOps). Regular security audits, penetration testing, and timely patching. Strong access controls and data encryption.
*   **Risk: Cloud Vendor Lock-in**
    *   **Mitigation:** Design services to be cloud-agnostic where possible. Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) to maintain portability. Abstract cloud-specific services using interfaces.
*   **Risk: Lack of Domain Expertise / Technical Debt**
    *   **Mitigation:** Engage domain experts in requirements gathering. Prioritize clean code and refactoring. Invest in continuous learning and documentation.
